/**
 * This program sorts the elements in odd positions in descending order and elements in even positions in ascending order.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize an array with the given elements.
 * 2. Separate the elements at odd positions and even positions into two separate arrays.
 * 3. Sort the elements in the odd positions array in descending order.
 * 4. Sort the elements in the even positions array in ascending order.
 * 5. Merge the sorted arrays back into a single array.
 * 6. Return the sorted array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 4]
 * Output: [9, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
